# L05: Agentic Workflow Patterns - Prompt Chaining Workflow

This lesson introduces the Prompt Chaining pattern for breaking down complex tasks into a sequence of smaller, dependent steps. It covers strategies for task decomposition, validation, and context management in sequential workflows.

Below are **10 build-style exercises** that progress from basic prompt chaining to sophisticated sequential workflow systems.

---

## 1) Basic sequential prompt chaining

**Goal:** Implement fundamental prompt chaining where outputs from one prompt become inputs to the next.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `basic_chain.py` with simple 3-step prompt chain.
2. Implement chain: input analysis → processing strategy → final output.
3. Use concrete example: text analysis → sentiment extraction → recommendation generation.
4. Ensure each step builds meaningfully on the previous step's output.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Each prompt in the chain produces output that feeds meaningfully into the next.
- Chain maintains logical flow from initial input to final output.
- Intermediate outputs are appropriately formatted for next step consumption.
- Final output demonstrates value added by sequential processing.

## 2) Task decomposition and dependency mapping

**Goal:** Learn to systematically break complex tasks into chainable subtasks with clear dependencies.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `task_decomposer.py` with automated task breakdown capabilities.
2. Implement decomposition strategies: functional breakdown, temporal sequencing, complexity reduction, skill specialization.
3. Map dependencies: required inputs, produced outputs, timing constraints, resource requirements.
4. Test with complex scenarios: market research, product development, event planning.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Complex tasks are broken into logical, manageable subtasks.
- Dependencies are accurately identified and mapped.
- Decomposition enables parallel execution where possible.
- Test scenarios demonstrate practical applicability.

## 3) Context propagation and state management

**Goal:** Implement robust context management systems that maintain relevant information across chain steps.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `context_manager.py` with sophisticated context tracking and propagation.
2. Implement context types: accumulated knowledge, current state, user preferences, external constraints.
3. Design propagation strategies: full context, summarized context, selective context, dynamic context.
4. Test with long chains where context accumulation is critical.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Context is consistently maintained and appropriately propagated.
- Different propagation strategies are correctly implemented and tested.
- Long chains maintain coherence without losing essential information.
- Context management handles token limits gracefully.

## 4) Validation gates and quality checkpoints

**Goal:** Build validation systems that ensure quality and correctness at each chain step.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `validation_gates.py` with comprehensive quality checking at each chain step.
2. Implement validation types: format checking, content validation, logical consistency, completeness verification.
3. Design checkpoint strategies: mandatory gates, conditional checks, progressive validation, rollback mechanisms.
4. Test with scenarios designed to trigger validation failures.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Validation gates correctly identify quality issues at each step.
- Different validation strategies are appropriately applied.
- Rollback mechanisms recover gracefully from validation failures.
- Quality checking prevents error propagation through the chain.

## 5) Branching and conditional chain flows

**Goal:** Implement chains that can branch into different paths based on intermediate results or conditions.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `branching_chains.py` with conditional flow control and parallel branching.
2. Implement branching logic: condition evaluation, path selection, parallel execution, path merging.
3. Design branch types: exclusive branches, parallel branches, conditional loops, adaptive routing.
4. Test with scenarios requiring different processing paths based on input characteristics.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Branching logic correctly evaluates conditions and selects appropriate paths.
- Parallel branches execute independently without interference.
- Path merging combines results appropriately from different branches.
- Adaptive routing optimizes processing based on real-time conditions.

## 6) Error recovery and chain resilience

**Goal:** Build robust error handling that can recover from failures without losing chain progress.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `resilient_chains.py` with comprehensive error recovery mechanisms.
2. Implement recovery strategies: step retry, alternative paths, graceful degradation, checkpoint restoration.
3. Design failure isolation: preventing error propagation, maintaining partial results, progressive recovery.
4. Test with various failure modes: API failures, validation errors, timeout conditions.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Error recovery maintains as much chain progress as possible.
- Failure isolation prevents single step failures from destroying entire chains.
- Recovery strategies are appropriate for different error types.
- Testing validates resilience under realistic failure conditions.

## 7) Performance optimization and parallel execution

**Goal:** Optimize chain performance through parallelization and intelligent resource management.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `optimized_chains.py` with performance optimization and parallel execution capabilities.
2. Implement optimization strategies: parallel step execution, resource pooling, caching, pre-computation.
3. Design load balancing: dynamic resource allocation, priority queuing, adaptive scheduling.
4. Test performance improvements with varying chain complexity and load conditions.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Parallelization correctly identifies and executes independent steps concurrently.
- Resource management improves overall chain throughput.
- Load balancing maintains performance under varying conditions.
- Performance testing demonstrates measurable improvements.

## 8) Dynamic chain modification and adaptation

**Goal:** Create chains that can modify their structure and behavior based on runtime conditions.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `adaptive_chains.py` with dynamic chain modification capabilities.
2. Implement adaptation mechanisms: step insertion, path modification, parameter tuning, strategy switching.
3. Design adaptation triggers: performance thresholds, error patterns, external events, user feedback.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Chain modifications are applied correctly without disrupting execution.
- Adaptation improves chain performance or output quality measurably.
- Modification triggers are appropriately sensitive and specific.
- Adaptation maintains chain integrity and correctness.

## Notes for Students

- **Chain design**: Plan the entire chain before implementing individual steps.
- **Context efficiency**: Balance context richness with computational efficiency.
- **Error planning**: Design error handling strategies during chain design, not as an afterthought.
- **Performance monitoring**: Track chain performance metrics from the beginning.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Context explosion**: Use summarization and selective context propagation.
- **Error cascading**: Implement validation gates and isolation mechanisms.
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Profile chains to identify slow steps and optimize accordingly.
- **State consistency**: Use proper synchronization for parallel execution.

## Extension Challenges

- Build visual chain designers with drag-and-drop step configuration.
- Create chain templates libraries for common task patterns.
