## Notes for Students

- **System thinking**: Focus on how components work together, not just individual components.
- **Scalability planning**: Design workflows that can handle increasing complexity and load.
- **Error resilience**: Build robust error handling from the beginning, don't add it later.
- **Performance awareness**: Monitor and optimize continuously, don't wait for problems.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Coordination overhead**: Balance coordination benefits with communication costs.
- **State consistency**: Implement proper state management to avoid race conditions.
- **Debugging complexity**: Build comprehensive logging and monitoring for troubleshooting.
- **Resource management**: Plan for resource allocation and cleanup in complex workflows.

## Extension Challenges

- Build visual workflow design tools with drag-and-drop interfaces.
- Create workflow marketplaces with reusable component libraries.
- Implement machine learning for automatic workflow optimization.
- Develop real-time collaboration tools for multi-developer workflow design.
