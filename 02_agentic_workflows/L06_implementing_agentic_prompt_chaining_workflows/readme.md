# L06: Implementing Agentic Prompt Chaining Workflows with Python

This lesson provides hands-on experience in implementing the Prompt Chaining pattern. Students build a multi-agent chain to solve a problem where information is passed sequentially, demonstrating practical application of prompt chaining concepts.

Below are **10 build-style exercises** that progress from basic chaining implementation to sophisticated sequential workflow systems.

## 1) Simple three-agent sequential chain

**Goal:** Implement a basic three-agent chain where each agent processes the output from the previous agent.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `simple_chain.py` with three sequential agents: Analyzer, Processor, and Synthesizer.
2. Implement chain flow: raw input → analysis → processing → synthesis → final output.
3. Use concrete example: customer feedback → sentiment analysis → issue categorization → response recommendation.
4. Test chain with various customer feedback scenarios to validate output quality.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Each agent produces output that meaningfully enhances the previous agent's work.
- Chain maintains logical flow from raw input to actionable final output.
- Output quality improves compared to single-agent processing.
- Different input scenarios produce appropriately varied outputs.

## 2) Dynamic chain length and agent selection

**Goal:** Build chains that dynamically adjust length and agent selection based on input complexity.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `dynamic_chain.py` with complexity assessment and agent selection logic.
2. Implement complexity indicators: input length, topic diversity, required expertise, processing time constraints.
3. Design agent selection rules: simple inputs → shorter chains, complex inputs → longer chains with specialists.
4. Test with inputs of varying complexity to validate chain adaptation.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Complexity assessment accurately identifies input processing requirements.
- Agent selection rules create appropriate chains for different input types.
- Dynamic chains demonstrate improved efficiency and output quality.
- Chain adaptation is transparent and explainable to users.

## 3) Context preservation and information transfer

**Goal:** Implement robust context preservation mechanisms that maintain information integrity throughout chains.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `context_manager.py` with context tracking and validation capabilities.
2. Implement context types: factual information, analysis results, processing metadata, user preferences.
3. Design transfer protocols: context packaging, validation, error detection, recovery.
4. Test context preservation with complex scenarios requiring extensive information retention.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Context preservation maintains all relevant information throughout chain execution.
- Transfer protocols prevent information loss and corruption.
- Complex scenarios demonstrate reliable context management.
- Error detection and recovery handle context-related failures effectively.

## 4) Parallel sub-chain integration

**Goal:** Enhance sequential chains with parallel sub-chains that process different aspects simultaneously.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `parallel_subchains.py` with parallel execution and result aggregation.
2. Implement parallel patterns: aspect-based analysis (technical, business, user), multi-perspective processing, independent validation.
3. Design aggregation strategies: weighted combination, consensus building, conflict resolution.
4. Test with scenarios requiring multiple simultaneous analysis perspectives.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Parallel sub-chains process different aspects simultaneously without conflicts.
- Aggregation strategies combine parallel results into coherent outputs.
- Multi-perspective processing provides richer, more comprehensive results.
- Execution time improves compared to purely sequential processing.

## 5) Chain validation and quality gates

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive validation and quality gates throughout chain execution.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `chain_validator.py` with quality assessment and gate enforcement.
2. Implement validation types: output format validation, content quality scoring, logical consistency checking, completeness verification.
3. Design gate policies: minimum quality thresholds, retry logic, alternative paths, human escalation.
4. Test validation with intentionally flawed inputs and edge cases.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Validation mechanisms catch quality issues at each chain stage.
- Quality gates prevent poor outputs from propagating through chains.
- Retry logic and alternative paths maintain chain progress when possible.
- Human escalation handles cases that cannot be automatically resolved.

## 6) Error recovery and chain resilience

**Goal:** Build comprehensive error recovery mechanisms that maintain chain functionality under failure conditions.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `chain_resilience.py` with error detection, handling, and recovery capabilities.
2. Implement error types: agent failures, timeout errors, format violations, content errors.
3. Design recovery strategies: retry with modification, skip and continue, alternative agent paths, graceful degradation.
4. Test resilience with fault injection and stress testing.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Error detection identifies all common failure modes quickly and accurately.
- Recovery strategies maintain chain progress wherever possible.
- Alternative paths provide acceptable results when primary processing fails.
- Stress testing validates chain stability under adverse conditions.

## 7) Performance optimization and caching

**Goal:** Optimize chain performance through intelligent caching and processing optimization.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `chain_optimizer.py` with caching, optimization, and performance monitoring.
2. Implement caching strategies: result caching, intermediate state caching, context caching, pattern recognition.
3. Design optimization techniques: parallel execution, agent pooling, batch processing, precomputation.
4. Test optimization effectiveness with performance benchmarking.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Caching strategies significantly reduce redundant processing without compromising quality.
- Optimization techniques improve chain throughput and response times.
- Performance monitoring provides insights for continuous optimization.
- Benchmarking demonstrates measurable performance improvements.

4. Test composition with building complex workflows from simpler, reusable components.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Chain components are truly modular and reusable across different contexts.
- Composition patterns enable flexible workflow construction.
- Complex workflows are efficiently built from proven, tested components.
