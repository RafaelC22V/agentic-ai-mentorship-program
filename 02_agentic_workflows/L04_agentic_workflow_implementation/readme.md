# L04: Agentic Workflow Implementation

This lesson covers the practical aspects of translating agentic workflow models into Python code. Students learn to structure agent logic, define agent classes, and orchestrate their interactions using established software engineering patterns.

Below are **10 build-style exercises** that progress from basic agent implementation to sophisticated workflow orchestration systems.

---

## 1) Basic agent class structure and interface

**Goal:** Implement foundational agent classes with consistent interfaces and core functionality.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `base_agent.py` with abstract base class defining standard agent interface.
2. Implement core methods: `process()`, `configure()`, `get_status()`, `reset()`, and `shutdown()`.
3. Add standard properties: agent_id, agent_type, configuration, state, and performance_metrics.
4. Create sample concrete agent classes that inherit from the base class.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Base agent class provides consistent interface for all agent implementations.
- Core methods handle standard agent lifecycle operations effectively.
- Properties enable agent identification, configuration, and monitoring.
- Concrete implementations demonstrate proper inheritance and interface compliance.

**Notes:**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional
import uuid

class BaseAgent(ABC):
    def __init__(self, agent_type: str, config: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        self.agent_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.agent_type = agent_type
        self.configuration = config or {}
        self.state = "initialized"
        self.performance_metrics = {}
    
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, input_data: Any) -> Any:
        """Process input and return output"""
        pass
```

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Communication system enables reliable message passing between all agents.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Orchestration engine reliably executes complex workflows with multiple agents.
- Different execution models handle various workflow patterns effectively.
- State management enables workflow resilience and recovery capabilities.
- Monitoring provides comprehensive visibility into workflow execution.

1. Create `config_manager.py` with hierarchical configuration and dependency resolution.
2. Implement configuration sources: files, environment variables, command-line arguments, runtime parameters.
3. Design dependency injection system for agent instantiation and workflow composition.
4. Add configuration validation and default value management.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Configuration system provides flexible, maintainable parameter management.
- Multiple configuration sources enable deployment flexibility.

**Goal:** Build comprehensive error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms for production workflows.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `fault_tolerance.py` with error detection, handling, and recovery capabilities.
2. Implement error types: transient failures, permanent failures, configuration errors, resource exhaustion.
3. Design recovery strategies: retry with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms, graceful degradation.
4. Add fault injection and testing capabilities for resilience validation.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Error handling covers all common failure modes comprehensively.
- Recovery strategies maintain workflow progress wherever possible.
- Fault tolerance mechanisms prevent cascading failures.
- Testing capabilities validate resilience under various failure scenarios.

## 6) Performance monitoring and metrics collection

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive performance monitoring with metrics collection and analysis.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `performance_monitor.py` with metrics collection and analysis capabilities.
2. Implement metric types: throughput, latency, error rates, resource utilization, business metrics.
3. Design collection mechanisms: agent instrumentation, workflow tracking, system monitoring.
4. Add analysis features: trend detection, anomaly identification, performance optimization recommendations.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Monitoring system captures all relevant performance and business metrics.
- Collection mechanisms provide accurate, real-time visibility.
- Analysis features identify performance issues and optimization opportunities.

3. Design recovery mechanisms: automatic restart, manual intervention, partial recovery, state reconstruction.
4. Add data consistency and integrity validation for persisted state.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Persistence mechanisms reliably capture workflow state at critical points.
- Recovery mechanisms restore workflows to consistent states after interruptions.
- Data consistency validation prevents corruption and state inconsistencies.
- Performance impact of persistence is minimized and acceptable.
