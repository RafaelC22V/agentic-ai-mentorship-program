# L08: Implementing Agentic Routing Workflows with Python

This lesson provides hands-on implementation of routing systems where a router agent uses an LLM to classify a query and then dispatches it to the correct specialist agent, which may involve orchestrating sub-tasks. Students build practical routing systems with intelligent decision-making.

Below are **10 build-style exercises** that progress from basic routing implementation to sophisticated intelligent routing systems.

3. Design specialist agents for each category with appropriate capabilities.
4. Test routing accuracy with diverse query types and validate specialist assignment.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- LLM accurately classifies queries into predefined categories.
- Routing logic correctly assigns tasks to appropriate specialist agents.
- Specialist agents demonstrate relevant expertise for their assigned tasks.
- Routing decisions are consistent and explainable.

**Notes:**

```python
class LLMRouter:
    def __init__(self, openai_client):
        self.client = openai_client
        self.specialists = {
            "technical": TechnicalSupportAgent(),
            "sales": SalesAgent(),
            "content": ContentAgent(),
            "analysis": DataAnalysisAgent()
        }
    
    def classify_task(self, query):
        prompt = f"""Classify this query into one of these categories:
        - technical: Technical support, bugs, troubleshooting
        - sales: Sales inquiries, pricing, product information
        - content: Content creation, writing, editing
        - analysis: Data analysis, reporting, insights
        
        Query: {query}
        Category:"""
        # Implementation here
