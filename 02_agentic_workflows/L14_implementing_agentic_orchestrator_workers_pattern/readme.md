# L14: Implementing Agentic Orchestrator-Workers Pattern in Python

This lesson provides hands-on implementation of the orchestrator-workers pattern where students implement a market analysis report generator. An Orchestrator agent creates a plan, assigns tasks to news, competitor, and trend analysis workers, and then synthesizes their findings into comprehensive reports.

Below are **10 build-style exercises** that progress from basic orchestration implementation to sophisticated market analysis systems.

        # Plan analysis
        plan = self.create_analysis_plan(request)
        
        # Assign tasks to workers
        results = {}
        for task in plan.tasks:
            worker = self.workers[task.worker_type]
            results[task.id] = worker.execute(task)
