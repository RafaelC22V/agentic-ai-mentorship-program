# L12: Implementing Agentic Evaluator-Optimizer Workflows with Python

This lesson provides hands-on implementation of evaluator-optimizer systems where students build a two-agent system (a creator and a critic) that works in a loop. The creator generates a solution, and the critic provides feedback until the solution meets all constraints.

Below are **10 build-style exercises** that progress from basic creator-critic loops to sophisticated self-improving systems.

## 1) Basic creator-critic loop implementation

**Goal:** Build a fundamental creator-critic system with simple generation, evaluation, and refinement cycles.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `basic_creator_critic.py` with separate Creator and Critic agent classes.
2. Implement Creator agent that generates content based on requirements (e.g., marketing copy, technical documentation).
3. Design Critic agent that evaluates content against specific criteria and provides actionable feedback.
4. Build coordination loop that iterates until quality thresholds are met or maximum iterations reached.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Creator generates initial content that addresses the given requirements.
- Critic provides specific, actionable feedback for content improvement.
- Coordination loop demonstrates measurable quality improvement over iterations.
- System terminates appropriately when quality goals are met or iteration limits reached.

**Notes:**

```python
class CreatorAgent:
    def __init__(self, openai_client):
        self.client = openai_client
    
    def generate_content(self, requirements, feedback=None):
        prompt = f"Create content for: {requirements}"
        if feedback:
            prompt += f"\nPrevious feedback to address: {feedback}"
        # Implementation here
        
class CriticAgent:
    def __init__(self, openai_client):
        self.client = openai_client
    
    def evaluate_content(self, content, criteria):
        prompt = f"Evaluate this content against criteria: {criteria}\nContent: {content}"
        # Return structured feedback
```
