# L09: Agentic Workflow Patterns - Parallelization

This lesson introduces the Parallelization pattern for executing multiple agent tasks concurrently. It covers strategies for task decomposition (sharding, aspect-based) and result aggregation to optimize workflow performance and throughput.

Below are **10 build-style exercises** that progress from basic parallel execution to sophisticated concurrent workflow orchestration.

**Goal:** Implement fundamental parallel execution where multiple agents process different aspects of a task simultaneously.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `basic_parallel.py` with simple parallel execution and result synchronization.

3. Design task splitting: independent aspects, parallel data processing, concurrent analysis.
4. Test with tasks that can be naturally divided into independent parallel components.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Parallel execution demonstrates measurable performance improvement over sequential processing.
- Synchronization correctly waits for all parallel tasks to complete before proceeding.
- Task splitting identifies appropriate independent components for parallel processing.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Sharding strategies distribute data efficiently across available processing agents.
