from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import queue

class ThreadedAgentExecutor:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents
        self.results = queue.Queue()
    
    def execute_parallel(self, input_data):
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=len(self.agents)) as executor:
            futures = []
            for agent in self.agents:
                future = executor.submit(agent.process, input_data)
                futures.append((agent.name, future))
            
            results = {}
            for name, future in futures:
