# L02: Designing Multi-Agent Architecture

This lesson explains the core components of multi-agent systems and how to design their high-level architecture. You'll learn to create scalable, maintainable architectures that support complex agent interactions and workflows.

Below are **10 build-style exercises** that progress from basic architectural concepts to sophisticated multi-agent system designs.

**Goal:** Build systems for managing agent lifecycles, including development, testing, deployment, and updates.

**Build steps:**

1. Create `agent_repository.py` with agent version control and deployment management.
2. Implement repository features: agent versioning, dependency management, configuration management, rollback capabilities.
3. Design deployment patterns: blue-green deployment, canary releases, rolling updates, feature flags.
4. Test with scenarios involving agent updates and configuration changes in live systems.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Repository systems manage agent versions and dependencies reliably.

## Notes for Students

- **Architecture documentation**: Maintain clear architectural documentation and decision records.
- **Technology choices**: Consider technology implications for scalability, maintainability, and performance.
- **Design patterns**: Leverage proven patterns but adapt them to multi-agent system requirements.
- **Stakeholder alignment**: Ensure architectural decisions align with business and operational requirements.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Over-engineering**: Start with simple architectures and evolve based on actual requirements.
- **Single points of failure**: Design for distributed operation from the beginning.
