# Agentic AI Mentorship Program

Welcome to the **Agentic AI Mentorship Program**! This repository is designed to help students and developers systematically evolve their AI agent development skills from foundational prompting techniques to advanced multi-agent systems through hands-on, build-style exercises and real-world scenarios.

## Purpose

This program provides a structured, progressive learning path for Agentic AI development. It covers advanced prompting techniques, agentic workflow patterns, agent building with tools and memory, and sophisticated multi-agent system orchestration. Each module contains step-by-step rubrics, acceptance criteria, and recommended best practices, making it ideal for self-study, bootcamps, or guided mentorship.

## Structure

The repository is organized into four main levels corresponding to the Agentic AI Nanodegree curriculum:

### **01_prompting_for_effective_llm_reasoning_and_planning/** (Base Level - 14 Lessons)

### **02_agentic_workflows/** (Mid Level - 16 Lessons) 
Architect intelligent systems using core agentic workflow patterns. Learn to design and build teams of AI agents using Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, and advanced orchestration patterns.

**Key Topics:**
- Agentic workflow fundamentals and modeling
- Prompt Chaining workflows for sequential task decomposition
- Routing patterns for task classification and delegation
- Parallelization for concurrent agent execution

### **03_building_agents/** (Advanced Level - 23 Lessons)
Build robust AI agents with tool integration, structured outputs, state management, and memory systems. Create data-driven agents that interact with external APIs, databases, and perform advanced retrieval tasks.

**Key Topics:**
- Tool integration via function calling
- Structured outputs with Pydantic validation
- Agent state management and transitions
- Short-term and long-term memory systems
- External API and database integration
- Web search and agentic RAG implementation
- Agent evaluation and performance metrics
- **Project:** GamerPlay - An AI Research Agent for the Video Game Industry

### **04_multi_agent_systems/** (Master Level - 15 Lessons)
Master coordinated teams of AI agents. Learn to orchestrate complex workflows, manage distributed state, implement advanced routing, and build production-ready multi-agent systems.

**Key Topics:**
- Multi-agent architecture design and implementation
- Agent orchestration and activity coordination
- Advanced routing and data flow management
- Distributed state management and coordination
- Multi-agent RAG for specialized retrieval
- Production deployment and monitoring
- **Project:** The Woody Paper Company Sales Team

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have OpenAI API access, basic Python knowledge, and familiarity with generative AI concepts.

2. **Start at your level**: Begin with the appropriate level based on your experience:
   - **New to AI agents?** Start with 01_prompting_for_effective_llm_reasoning_and_planning
   - **Know basic prompting?** Jump to 02_agentic_workflows
   - **Understand workflows?** Begin with 03_building_agents
   - **Want advanced systems?** Start with 04_multi_agent_systems

3. **Follow the progression**: Each lesson within a level builds on the previous. Complete exercises in order for the smoothest learning experience.

4. **Practice hands-on**: Each exercise requires implementing working code. Don't just read - build and test!

5. **Meet acceptance criteria**: Each exercise has specific, verifiable outcomes. Ensure you meet all criteria before proceeding.

6. **Complete projects**: End-of-level projects synthesize all lesson concepts into comprehensive, portfolio-worthy applications.
