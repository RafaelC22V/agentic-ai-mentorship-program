## Notes for Students

- **State design**: Design state structures that are both comprehensive and efficient.
- **Concurrency handling**: Plan for concurrent access to shared state from the beginning.
- **Recovery planning**: Build recovery mechanisms before they're needed in production.
- **Performance monitoring**: Monitor state performance continuously to identify issues early.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **State explosion**: Keep state focused on essential information to prevent overwhelming complexity.
- **Concurrency conflicts**: Use appropriate locking and synchronization mechanisms.
- **Memory leaks**: Implement proper cleanup and garbage collection for old state data.
- **Performance degradation**: Profile state access patterns and optimize critical paths.

## Extension Challenges

- Build visual state machine designers with simulation and testing capabilities.
- Create state analytics platforms that identify optimization opportunities.
- Implement automatic state pruning systems that remove obsolete information.
