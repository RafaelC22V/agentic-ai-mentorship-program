2. Implement dynamic features: runtime model creation, schema migration, version compatibility, field mapping.
3. Include model factory patterns and configuration-driven generation.
4. Test with evolving schema requirements and backward compatibility needs.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Dynamic model generation creates valid Pydantic models from configuration.
