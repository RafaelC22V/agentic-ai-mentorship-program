## Notes for Students

- **Foundation first**: Build solid foundations before adding advanced features.
- **Testing early**: Implement testing alongside development, not as an afterthought.
- **Configuration flexibility**: Design for easy customization and deployment variation.
- **Error resilience**: Plan for failures and build recovery into every component.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **API rate limits**: Implement proper rate limiting and request queuing from the start.
- **Context management**: Design context systems to handle long conversations gracefully.
- **Error cascades**: Isolate components to prevent single failures from bringing down the entire agent.
- **Configuration complexity**: Use clear defaults and validation to simplify setup.

## Extension Challenges

- Build agent analytics dashboards with real-time performance monitoring.
- Create agent personality testing suites for validating persona consistency.
- Implement agent A/B testing frameworks for optimizing behavior.
- Develop agent deployment templates for common use cases and environments.
