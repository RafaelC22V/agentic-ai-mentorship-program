## Notes for Students

- **Evaluation design**: Design evaluation systems before building agents, not after.
- **Metric selection**: Choose metrics that align with actual business objectives and user needs.
- **Continuous improvement**: Use evaluation results to iteratively improve agent performance.
- **Bias awareness**: Consider evaluation bias and ensure fair assessment across different scenarios.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Metric gaming**: Design metrics that can't be easily gamed without genuine improvement.
- **Evaluation overhead**: Balance comprehensive evaluation with system performance impact.
- **Context dependency**: Ensure evaluation accounts for different contexts and use cases.
- **Subjectivity**: Use multiple evaluation methods to reduce subjective bias.

## Extension Challenges

- Build automated evaluation systems that can create new test cases dynamically.
- Create evaluation marketplaces where different evaluation methods can be shared.
- Implement predictive evaluation systems that anticipate performance issues.
- Develop evaluation explanation systems that help understand performance results.
