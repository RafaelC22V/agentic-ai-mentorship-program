# Project: Trip Planner - A Multi-Agent Travel Assistant System

## Project Overview

In this capstone project for the Prompting for Effective LLM Reasoning and Planning course, you'll build a comprehensive travel planning system called "Trip Planner." This system demonstrates advanced prompting techniques including role-based prompting, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, ReAct frameworks, and feedback loops working together to create a sophisticated travel assistant.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Integrate multiple prompting techniques into a cohesive system
- Implement role-based personas for specialized travel expertise
- Use CoT reasoning for complex travel planning decisions  
- Apply ReAct frameworks for information gathering and action taking
- Create feedback loops that improve planning quality over time
- Build a user-friendly interface that showcases agentic AI capabilities

## System Architecture

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality (Required)

1. **Multi-Persona Travel Planning**
   - Implement all 5 travel personas with distinct characteristics
   - Each persona contributes specialized knowledge to trip planning
   - Personas interact naturally and resolve conflicting recommendations

2. **Chain-of-Thought Trip Analysis**
   - Use CoT for complex travel decisions (destination selection, itinerary optimization)
   - Show clear reasoning steps for all major planning decisions
   - Include self-validation and error checking in reasoning chains

3. **ReAct Information Gathering**
   - Implement ReAct cycles for gathering travel information
   - Use simulated tools: weather API, attraction database, flight search, hotel finder
   - Show clear Thought-Action-Observation patterns in planning

4. **Feedback-Driven Optimization**
   - Collect user feedback on generated plans
   - Implement learning mechanisms that improve future recommendations
   - Show measurable improvement in plan quality over time

5. **User Interface**
   - Clean, intuitive interface for travel planning conversations
   - Clear display of different persona contributions
   - Visual representation of reasoning chains and decision making

### Advanced Features (Extension Challenges)

1. **Dynamic Persona Adaptation**
   - Personas adapt their expertise based on destination and travel style
   - Cultural sensitivity adjustments for international travel
   - Seasonal expertise shifts (winter sports vs summer activities)

2. **Collaborative Plan Refinement**
   - Multiple personas collaborate to refine and improve plans
   - Conflict resolution when personas disagree
   - Consensus building for optimal recommendations

3. **Real-Time Plan Adjustment**
   - Adapt plans based on changing conditions (weather, availability, prices)
   - Re-plan using ReAct when initial plans become infeasible
   - Maintain trip coherence during dynamic adjustments

4. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Track planning effectiveness and user satisfaction
   - Identify most successful persona combinations
   - Optimize prompting strategies based on performance data

## Detailed Technical Specifications

### Persona Implementation

Each travel persona must include:

```python
class TravelPersona:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Persona Name"
        self.expertise = ["area1", "area2", "area3"]
        self.communication_style = "description"
        self.priorities = ["priority1", "priority2"]
        self.knowledge_base = "specialized knowledge areas"
    
    def generate_system_prompt(self):
        # Return persona-specific system prompt
        
    def analyze_travel_request(self, request):
        # Use CoT to analyze travel requirements from persona perspective
        
    def contribute_to_plan(self, current_plan, user_preferences):
        # Add persona-specific recommendations to existing plan
```

### CoT Planning Implementation

```python
class CoTPlanningEngine:
    def plan_trip(self, destination, constraints, preferences):
        # Step 1: Analyze requirements
        # Step 2: Research destination
        # Step 3: Identify key activities and logistics
        # Step 4: Optimize for constraints
        # Step 5: Validate plan feasibility
        # Step 6: Generate final recommendations
        
    def validate_reasoning(self, reasoning_chain):
        # Check logical consistency and feasibility
```

### ReAct Implementation

```python
class ReActTravelAgent:
    def gather_travel_info(self, query):
        thought = self.analyze_information_needs(query)
        action = self.select_information_gathering_action(thought)
        observation = self.execute_action(action)
        
        if self.information_sufficient(observation):
            return self.synthesize_response(thought, action, observation)
        else:
            return self.gather_travel_info(self.refine_query(query, observation))
```
