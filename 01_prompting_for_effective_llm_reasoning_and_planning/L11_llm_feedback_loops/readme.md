# L11: LLM Feedback Loops

This lesson explains the conceptual framework for building self-improving systems where an agent uses feedback from its own actions to iteratively refine its output. You'll learn to create systems that can evaluate and improve their own performance.

Below are **10 build-style exercises** that progress from basic feedback collection to sophisticated self-improving AI systems.
