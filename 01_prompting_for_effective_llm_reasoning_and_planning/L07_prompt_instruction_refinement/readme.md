## Notes for Students

- **Systematic approach**: Always analyze prompts systematically rather than making random changes.
- **Measurement focus**: Measure improvement objectively rather than relying on subjective assessment.
- **Component isolation**: Test one component change at a time to identify what works.
- **Domain awareness**: Consider domain-specific requirements when refining prompts.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Over-optimization**: Use convergence criteria to prevent excessive refinement iterations.
- **Component conflicts**: Test component interactions, not just individual improvements.
- **Measurement bias**: Use diverse test cases and multiple evaluation criteria.
- **Generalization failure**: Validate improvements across different scenarios and domains.

## Extension Challenges

- Build prompt version control systems with change tracking and rollback capabilities.
- Create collaborative prompt refinement platforms with expert review and validation.
- Implement machine learning approaches for automatic prompt improvement discovery.
- Develop prompt performance prediction models that estimate effectiveness before testing.
